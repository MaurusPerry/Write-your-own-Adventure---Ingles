                After the creation of the Animal Farm, the Seven Commandments of Animalism are established, which promote equality between animals so that each animal is equally important. After the battle, the animals destroy symbols of their oppression, such as whips and harnesses, and revel in their victory, looking to the horizon for a better future. <br><br>

                But in an unexpected twist, the men led by Jones, after a time in exile, return to the farm with a plan. With cunning, they manage to infiltrate the farm and with a surprise blow they defeat the animals, who, disillusioned, find themselves trapped again in human tyranny.<br><br>

                Locked in the stable, the animals are immersed in sadness. However, one day, Jones throws away some old computers and projectors he had in the barn. This is how the idea of ​​playing Haxball was born. Over time, animals become experts, creating strategies and working as a team. Hours turn into days, and soon they forget, at least a little, of their cruel reality.<br><br>

                Before long, they become famous in the virtual world, challenging players from all over the world. Their greatest rivalry is with the Chileans, the best players in the world, who believe they are invincible, and also play at home. But the animals, with their dedication and teamwork, manage to defeat them again and again, demonstrating their superiority and making Chileans around the world stop playing Haxball due to the humiliation suffered. This fills the hearts of the farm animals with joy and pride.<br><br>

                Although they are still basically trapped, in the world of Haxball they discover freedom and camaraderie. In their little virtual reality, they feel more alive than ever, fighting together and becoming true pros, proving that, even in sadness, there is always room for hope and fun.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
