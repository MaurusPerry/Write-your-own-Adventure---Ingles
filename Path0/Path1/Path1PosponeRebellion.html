                Despite the shortage of food, and the deep anger they felt 
                towards Jones and his men, the animals go back to the farm to plan their attack on 
                Jones's men. However, they were convinced by the pigs, especially Snowball, who 
                supported the idea that it was not the right time for a rebellion. The pigs claimed that more
                planning was necessary to ensure the success of the rebellion. Thus, the animals, gullible 
                and confident in their own ignorance, once again fell into Jones's clutches. <br><br>

                Three weeks later, Jones resumed taking care of the farm more frequently and effectively 
                than before. A clear immediate joy could be observed among the animals, who believed they
                had made the right decision in not rebelling. Thanks to a good harvest and a bit of luck,
                Jones managed to feed the animals and reduce the criticism towards him. Over time, 
                the idea of rebellion, once so hopeful, slowly faded away. <br><br>

                The last resistance end when Snowball, when completely forgot beast of england words and melody. 
                The farm, which once dreamed of the dawn of freedom, was trapped in eternal conformity. 
                The animals, like puppets, accepted their fate not with visible chains, but by succumbing 
                to the chains of their own minds. Their spinning wheel, relentless and endless, trapped them 
                in an endless dance, condemning them to a gray and hopeless existence. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
