                After the lashings from Jones’s men, the suffering on the farm reached a breaking point. 
                The animals have enought , and Snowball, driven by hunger and desperation, was 
                the first to rise against Jones and his men. The animals, led by Snowball, charged into battle 
                for the food and justice they believed they deserved. <br><br>

                Jones, taken aback by the radical change in the animals’ behavior, reacted with desperation. 
                His mind clouded by alcohol, he tried to control the situation by firing his gun haphazardly. 
                Jones’s erratic shooting, rather than stopping the animals, resulted in the downfall of several 
                of his own men. Amid the chaos, Boxer bit Jones, causing him to drop the gun, which was 
                then picked up by Snowball. <br><br>

                Snowball, with a mix of fear and determination, managed to activate the gun and, with a 
                precise shot, ended Jones’s life. The farm fell silent, marked by the end of a cruel regime 
                and a mix of confusion and relief among the animals. <br><br>

                With the men of Jones fleeing and the now-widowed Mrs. Jones leaving, the animals faced 
                the task of deciding their future. The corpse of Jones and the disorder stood as witnesses to
                a successful rebellion, but Snowball saw beyond mere liberation. As the animals discussed <br><br>
                 
                what to do next, Snowball, overwhelmed by the combination of his recent victory and 
                newfound power, realized the opportunity before him.
