                Instead of taking advantage of the chaos to consolidate his power, Snowball saw a 
                unique opportunity to fulfill the rebellion's ideals. <br><br> 

                "Fellows," Snowball began firmly, "we have not fought and sacrificed so much just to replace 
                one tyrant with another. We must build a farm where we all live in true equality and freedom. 
                But our mission does not end here. The oppression we have known is not unique; there are 
                many other farms where animals suffer just as we do. If we want a better future, we must 
                share our message of liberation. <br><br> 
                
                The animals, inspired by Snowball's words, united in a new fervor. With Snowball at the 
                helm, he began work on rebuilding the farm and implementing the ideals that had been the 
                basis of his rebellion: equality, justice, and well-being for all. <br><br> 
                
                Snowball, understanding that the liberation of the farm could not be an isolated achievement, 
                devised an audacious plan. He began sending emissaries to neighboring farms, who, using 
                Snowball's experience and oratory skills, brought messages of hope and brotherhood to 
                other farms that were also under the yoke of cruel farmers. <br><br> 

                News of the successful rebellion on Animal Farm spread quickly, and the seeds of revolution 
                were sown in the hearts of animals on other farms. Snowball became a revolutionary leader 
                not only of his own farm, but of a cause that extended beyond its boundaries. The  
                emissaries return with stories of changes in other farms; Some were already rebelling, while  
                others were on their way.<br><br> 
                
                The farm began to prosper under Snowball's management. Over time, the ideals of the 
                rebellion became a beacon of hope for animals across the continent. The Animal 
                Farm became the epicenter of positive change, and the ideals of justice and equality became 
                a reality lived by many, not just dreamed of by a few. The land, which had once been marked 
                by oppression and suffering, was transformed into a symbol of the possibility of a better 
                future. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
