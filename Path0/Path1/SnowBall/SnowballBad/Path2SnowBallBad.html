                Snowball saw the rebellion as a means to free himself from any 
                external authority, including the old rules he had once supported.<br><br>

                Snowball began to take control of the farm more methodically. Initially, he tried to consolidate 
                his power with speeches and promises of a better future, but soon showed his true colors. 
                Armed with the gun and possessing a cunning superior to that of the other animals, 
                Snowball started imposing his dominance through force and intimidation. His ingenuity, 
                which had once been a tool for the rebellion, transformed into an instrument of tyranny.<br><br>

                With each passing day, Snowball descended further into the madness of absolute power. His 
                behavior became increasingly erratic and cruel. The promises of equality and freedom 
                crumbled under the weight of his new oppressive policies. The animals who once admired 
                him began to fear him, as Snowball had turned the farm into a dark reflection of the tyranny 
                they had sought to eradicate.<br><br>

                Snowball ordered the construction of higher walls around the farm to keep the animals under 
                control. Meetings and assemblies turned into mere acts of obedience rather than collective 
                discussions. The old ideals of the rebellion were erased and replaced by a new set of laws 
                that kept the animals in a constant state of submission.<br><br>

                The farm, which had begun as a place of hope and freedom, became a field of oppression 
                under Snowballâ€™s tyranny. His madness and ability to manipulate others created a regime 
                even more relentless than that of Jones, proving that true slavery lay not in physical chains, 
                but in the invisible chains of power and madness. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
