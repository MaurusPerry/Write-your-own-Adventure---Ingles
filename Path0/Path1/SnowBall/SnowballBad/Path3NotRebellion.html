                One day, upon waking up, Snowball looked in the mirror and found himself completely 
                transformed into a human. Her skin was pale, her hands were soft, and her eyes 
                reflected a humanity he had never known. confused, he walked out into the farm yard, 
                where the animals looked at him with a mixture of horror and resignation.<br><br>

                Snowball, now a human in every sense, attempted to reassert his dominance, but the animals, 
                unable to distinguish him from their former oppressors, turned away from him. The farm 
                fell into a terrorific silence, with Snowball finding him self on the creature which he had 
                once fought to destroy. <br><br>
                
                The transformation was complete, Snowball had not only adopted human vices, but had physically 
                become one of them, locked in a prison of flesh and blood, and condemned to live among the animals 
                who had once called him their leader. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
