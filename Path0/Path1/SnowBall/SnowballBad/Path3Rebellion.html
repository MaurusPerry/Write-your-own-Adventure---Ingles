                Snowball, on his throne built by enslaved animals, arrogantly smoked a cigarette. 
                In his hand lay the weapon that symbolized his power and complete dominance over the other animals. 
                Blinded by vices, arrogance and madness, he never believed that animals would even dare to rebel. 
                Yet they were, staring at him with gaze. <br><br>

                Seeing the crowd approaching, Snowball pointed his gun at them, but the animals, willing to sacrifice their 
                lives rather than endure further torture, advanced fowards him. Snowball, faced with his imminent fall, 
                realized that he had no escape. Sliding the gun towards his own head, he slowly pulled the trigger and discharged 
                the last bullet, ending his life. No one knows if he did it to avoid his own suffering or in a last act of 
                sadness when he realized what he had become. However, what was clear was that there he lay, motionless on the ground.<br><br>

                The animals celebrated their release, but soon realized a harsh reality, the great walls built by Snowball had 
                enclosed them all. Only he knew the location of the key that could free them, and now, dead, that information was 
                lost forever.<br><br>

                Weeks and months passed. Without access to the outside, the situation became desperate. The animals, in their fight 
                to survive, began to devour each other. The scarcity of food and water led them to a brutal and even more primitive existence.<br><br>

                The rebellion, although victorious, left the animals trapped in a new nightmare, a dark irony resulting from their 
                fierce but futile quest for freedom. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
